# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project focused on analyzing Twitter data. The project utilizes the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model along with its tokenizer for sentiment analysis tasks. The goal is to classify tweets into three sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral.

## Features
- **Model:** The sentiment analysis model is built using the BERT architecture, known for its effectiveness in capturing context and nuances in text data.
- **Tokenizer:** BERT tokenizer is employed to preprocess the Twitter data and prepare it for input into the BERT model.
- **Training and Validation:** The repository includes scripts for training the sentiment analysis model. It logs training and validation losses and provides visualizations to monitor the model's performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, and recall curves are calculated and plotted for each sentiment class, providing insights into the model's classification performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Before training the model, the repository visualizes the Twitter data through various methods like bar plots, word clouds, etc., to gain an understanding of the dataset's characteristics and distribution.
